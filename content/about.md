## My Name is Dan

USA. Working in Information Security. White hat. Gamer. Dad. Views are my own. Though feel free to use my notes. I'm not going to pretend to have all the answers, but I took down a lot of notes and I feel like I should preserve them somehow.

Thus: this site.

I initially bought this site to host my [2020 Holiday Hack Challenge Writeup](https://hhc2020.agrohacksstuff.io), and I figured that I was considering adding my notes to a public page, so why not?

## Why "Agr0"?

This comes from my nickname that I've been given at work, "Angry Dan." My gamer tag is Agro_dan. I just shortened it to Agro, and since Agro is taken in most places I just stylized it and made the last "o" a zero. Besides, shouldn't all hackers have a cool handle?

Also, a side note...I think I'm a pretty nice guy. I'm just cursed with a face that always looks angry. It's nothing personal I promise.

## What is the point of this?

I don't know. I have an immense collection of OneNote documents that I've created over the years as a means of remembering things I've learned previously. I figured I might as well publish some of what I've learned. I have the know-how and the resources, so why not?

## What framework does this site use?

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I experimented with a bunch of frameworks but ultimately wanted to stick to a static page generator for security and ease of use. I tried [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) but I don't know, it didn't really grab me. I'm of the opinion that web frameworks are awesome until they're not supported anymore, then you're left with an out-of-support and most likely completely vulnerable site. At least this site is static.

## What is your preferred OS?

In my profession I've always found it better to remain OS-agnostic. I game on Windows, I work on Ubuntu, I pentest on Kali, and sometimes I even use MacOS for things. Y'know, as long as someone else is paying for it. Use the right tool for the job.

## Where did you get your training?

I got my start in IT as a ColdFusion web developer once upon a time. I eventually became a system administrator for Unix/Linux infrastructure. After that I transitioned to Cyber Security, and with a background in learning how to build things, it was a pretty smooth transition to learning how to exploit that architecture. Since becoming a full time Information Security Specialist, I have obtained a fair amount of [SANS](https://www.sans.org/) training, as well as a large amount of self-training. The sheer amount of help and informational tools available to people who just want to get into the field these days is staggering. So much more than 10 or 15 years ago, and I can attest to that! All it takes is a will to learn.

## Do you have any advice for someone just starting out?

I always give the same advice to anyone that asks this, and it's to start up your own personal lab. I tend to use VMWare to do it virtually, but when I first started I just snagged up old PCs that people were throwing away anyway and tried out different Linux/Unix operating systems. From there I started on self-made projects: run a website, host a wiki that you can store your recipes on, run a DHCP and DNS server, or go for broke and just make stuff up to add to your network. A long time ago I wrote [a little script](https://github.com/AgroDan/sauron) that just alerted me whenever a new device joined my wireless network. The point is, the more you create, the more you learn about the service. Knowing how things work is the key to understanding how they can be exploited.

## What programming languages do you know?

When I think in terms of development, I tend to think in Python. But I've made a few things in Go, PHP, C, and Javascript/NodeJS. I also know Perl...but we all make mistakes, don't we?

## What is your favorite IDE?

I have a bunch I like. Sublime Text has been pretty swell, but I also like MS Visual Studio Code. But if I'm knee-deep in a large python project, I've yet to find an IDE that comes even remotely close to PyCharm Pro. It may be a little on the bloated side, but it is truly fantastic in terms of what you can do with it.

## What stuff do you hack?

Nothing illegal. I am constantly on a quest to learn. I will never admit that I'm the best at anything, but I have a fair bit of experience in the field. Typically I'm using Hack The Box or TryHackMe, and occasionally I'll mess around with things like Cryptopals or Advent of Code, and of course the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge.

## Can you join my CTF group?

Nah. I tried it a couple of times and personally I just don't have the time to do it all that much. I *love* CTF challenges, but if I have to do it on a schedule then that's just not going to happen. Being a dad that also works full time means I have very specific times where I get to do fun non-dad things, and usually CTF challenges are not conducive to my schedule. So really I would only drag your team down. Sorry!

## "Agro Hacks Stuff"...kinda like 0xdf hacks stuff?

I know. I don't mean to copy off this guy in terms of naming my site, he's an incredible dude that has a much better site with far more experience than myself. This is just the name I came up with when I was trying to buy a suitable domain name. I don't mean to take any credit where it's due, I just bought this domain without thinking too hard. You should probably be going to [his site](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/), anyway.

## How can I get in touch with you?

Probably best to email me at this address: 9vmxhgqp6@relay.firefox.com ...and yes, it's a real address. I'm using the firefox relay so I can just abandon it and spin up another one if it gets too much spam.
